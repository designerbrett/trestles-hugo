<p class="p1">Dr. Anderson grew up locally in Yorba Linda where he attended Esperanza High school and played football there. He then continued his studies of Chemistry at the <a name="University of California Riverside" id="University of California Riverside"></a><a class="links" title="University of California Riverside" href="http://www.ucr.edu/" target="_blank">University of California Riverside</a>. Following his undergraduate studies, he made the best decision of his scholastic career and attended the <a name="Southern California University of Health Sciences" id="Southern California University of Health Sciences"></a><a class="links" title="Southern California University of Health Sciences" href="http://scuhs.edu/" target="_blank">Southern California University of Health Sciences</a>, where he attained his degree as a Doctor of Chiropractic. Dr. Anderson has seen the positive effects of regular chiropractic care in his own life as he grew up suffering from several chronic allergies and digestive issues. However when he found chiropractic care while living in Arizona in 2005 his life was changed. Not only did his aches and pains resolve but so did the systemic problems he had lived with since childhood. Recognizing this change lead Dr. Anderson to where he is now. He has a strong passion for chiropractic and believes that in most cases drugs and/or surgery can be avoided through chiropractic adjustments as well as positive lifestyle alterations.</p>
<p class="p1">After working alongside other chiropractic colleagues in Placentia and Garden Grove, the decision to start his own practice was made. Dr. Anderson began his <a name="San Clemente Chiropractic" id="San Clemente Chiropractic"></a><a class="links" title="San Clemente Chiropractic" href="http://www.trestleschiropractic.com/contact-us" target="_self">San Clemente Chiropractic</a> office in July of 2013. Dr Anderson works part time in the film business as a Medical Technical Advisor most recently on Season 2 of the Netflix show Dead to Me.</p>

<p class="p1">From a young age, Dr. Skyler Alvord has made it his mission to have a positive impact on those he comes in contact with. This passion for reaching people continued with his decision to pursue a degree in psychology at <a href="https://www.pointloma.edu/">Point Loma Nazarene University</a> in San Diego, CA. Dr. Skyler focused on sports psychology, studying under one of the top sports psychologists in California. As he completed this degree, he encountered a soccer injury leaving him unable to lead his active lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">It was at this time that he discovered the wonders of chiropractic. Dr. Skyler was captivated by this form of healthcare as it not only took away his pain but also improved his body’s overall function as he began experiencing less allergy and asthma symptoms. This improvement was due to the decrease in interference in his nervous system and improved function of his immune system.</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Skyler received his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from <a class="links" title="Southern California University of Health Sciences" href="http://scuhs.edu/" target="_blank">Southern California University of Health Sciences</a>. Upon graduation, Dr. Skyler joined an office in Denver, Colorado. He has sought to reach people of all cultures, from the local homeless shelter, to international trips to El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. Missing the California weather, he relocated to San Clemente to pursue his passion for promoting wellness and excellence in human performance through chiropractic.</p>
