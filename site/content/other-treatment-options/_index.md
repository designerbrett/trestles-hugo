title: Other Treatment Options
---
There are a wide variety of treatment options offered by both medical and alternative medicine practitioners. Most doctors are focused on pain and symptom relief (secondary conditions), and they do an excellent job. People often start with medication or herbal/homeopathic remedies which can shut off pain receptors. If that doesn’t work, then courses of physical therapy may be used to strengthen muscular weakness, address spasm, or increase mobility. Injection programs to calm the site of pain come in next. When those don’t work, more invasive procedures like surgery start to fall into the picture.

All of these treatment programs are effective in the appropriate time and place and have different goals. Our goal at Trestles Chiropractic is to restore your Structural integrity.

Our Doctors have built relationships with health care providers throughout the community. If during the consultation they find that Structural Correction Chiropractic isn’t right for you, we will make sure to find the best practitioner to help resolve your specific condition.
