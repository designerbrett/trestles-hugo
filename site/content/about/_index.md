## Ryan Anderson DC

Dr. Anderson grew up locally in Yorba Linda where he attended Esperanza High school and played football there. He then continued his studies of Chemistry at the [](<>)[University of California Riverside](http://www.ucr.edu/ "University of California Riverside"). Following his undergraduate studies, he made the best decision of his scholastic career and attended the [](<>)[Southern California University of Health Sciences](http://scuhs.edu/ "Southern California University of Health Sciences"), where he attained his degree as a Doctor of Chiropractic. Dr. Anderson has seen the positive effects of regular chiropractic care in his own life as he grew up suffering from several chronic allergies and digestive issues. However when he found chiropractic care while living in Arizona in 2005 his life was changed. Not only did his aches and pains resolve but so did the systemic problems he had lived with since childhood. Recognizing this change lead Dr. Anderson to where he is now. He has a strong passion for chiropractic and believes that in most cases drugs and/or surgery can be avoided through chiropractic adjustments as well as positive lifestyle alterations.

After working alongside other chiropractic colleagues in Placentia and Garden Grove, the decision to start his own practice was made. Dr. Anderson began his [](<>)[San Clemente Chiropractic](http://www.trestleschiropractic.com/contact-us "San Clemente Chiropractic") office in July of 2013. Dr Anderson works part time in the film business as a Medical Technical Advisor most recently on Season 2 of the Netflix show Dead to Me.
