title: What is a Structural Shift?
---
In healthcare, there are established normal values for many things. There’s a standard for normal blood pressure, normal cholesterol, and normal vision. It doesn’t mean that we expect everyone to have a PERFECT measure, but there are healthy ranges for people depending on their age and situation.

Could your problems be the result of a Structural Shift?

At Trestles Chiropractic, we are looking for a significant *structural shift away from NORMAL that affects your overall function*. These shifts initially cause muscle spasms because your foundation (the spine, which carries all the messages from the brain to the body) is no longer stable and strong. Left uncorrected, the ligaments eventually deform, and finally they disrupt the NERVES traveling down the spinal cord.

This entire process is called **degeneration or spinal arthritis**, and is the direct result of wear and tear. It’s similar to having one under-inflated tire on your car; at first it’s not a big deal, but over time if you don’t fix it, the axle wears out faster than it should and eventually things start to fall apart.

At Trestles Chiropractic, we’re experts at Structural Correction. Using detailed analysis, we get to the heart of your problem to give you noticeable results, both in how you feel and how you function.
