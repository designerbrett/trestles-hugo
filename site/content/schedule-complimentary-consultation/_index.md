title: Schedule Complimentary Consultation
---

**Trestles Chiropractic is the Ultimate resource for Structural Correction in San Clemente, Dana Point, San Juan Capistrano, and Laguna Niguel.**

A consultation with the Doctor is just that. A simple conversation about your health. **This is not an Examination or Sales Pitch.**

This is an opportunity for us to get to know you as well as for you to learn about how we can help you achieve better health.

We offer 2 types of consultations:

1. A private One on One conversation with the Doctor. 
2. A group conversation where others will be receiving the same information about structural correction.

Following your consultation youâ€™ll have the option to move forward with a complete Structural Examination, either the same day or at a future date. A complete Structural Exam includes:

* Digital Structural Radiographs 
* Neuro-Structural Analysis 
* Digital

Structural Assessment * Physical Structural Analysis

Once again, there is no charge for a consultation, and there will be no high-pressured sales gimmicks.
