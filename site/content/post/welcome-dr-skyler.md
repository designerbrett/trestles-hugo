I would like to give a huge Welcome to Dr. Skyler Alvord to the Trestles Chiropractic team. I have been in talks with Dr. Skyler for a year and a half to bring him on board. Our hard work has finally paid off and I couldn't be more excited to have him work with my team. Check out his Bio below to get to know him a bit better.

From a young age, Dr. Skyler Alvord has made it his mission to have a positive impact on those he comes in contact with. This passion for reaching people continued with his decision to pursue a degree in psychology at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, CA. Dr. Skyler focused on sports psychology, studying under one of the top sports psychologists in California. As he completed this degree, he encountered a soccer injury leaving him unable to lead his active lifestyle. 

It was at this time that he discovered the wonders of chiropractic. Dr. Skyler was captivated by this form of healthcare as it not only took away his pain but also improved his bodyâ€™s overall function as he began experiencing less allergy and asthma symptoms. This improvement was due to the decrease in interference in his nervous system and improved function of his immune system.

Dr. Skyler received his Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Southern California University of Health Sciences.  Upon graduation, Dr. Skyler joined an office in Denver, Colorado. He has sought to reach people of all cultures, from the local homeless shelter, to international trips to El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. Missing the California weather, he relocated to San Clemente to pursue his passion for promoting wellness and excellence in human performance through chiropractic.

**Dr. Skyler will be in the office Wednesday and Friday when we were previously closed, as well as Tuesday and Sat. His hours will be similar to mine.**
